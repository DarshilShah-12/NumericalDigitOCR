# Numerical Digit OCR
This is an introductory project developed for the purpose of empirically understanding more about neural networks. Consider this the "Hello World" equivalent for machine learning. For training and testing, we used the MNIST database of handwritten digits, which can be found here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

# Development
As the goal of this project was to learn as much as possible, we performed all the mathematical calculations involved for components such as gradient descent and backpropagation manually using our knowledge of differential calculus and linear algebra rather than constructing the model in a framework like Keras. This is obviously not a best practice for a project used in production; however, for the purposes of learning, this strengthened our understanding of fundamentals picked up in the classroom and allowed us to put them to practical use.
